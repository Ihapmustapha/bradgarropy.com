# üí† uses

As a [developer][developer] and [tech][tech] lover in general, I use a lot of physical and digital stuff on a daily basis.
These things serve many purposes. They bring me enjoyment, connect me to other people, and serve as tools that help me create software.

I'm constantly improving and upgrading my setup, so expect this to change in the future.

If you want to know more details or have any questions, ask me in my [AMA][ama].

## üè† home office

I use my home office as a place to stream, play games, and work on personal projects. This setup is based around a custom built Windows PC that is getting pretty old!

As for accessories, I love clicky mechanical keyboards and large palm grip mice. I also find that dual monitor setups on Windows machines help maximize my productivity.

## üè¢ adobe office

At work everyone runs off of Apple laptops, so I joined the party. I decided to create a minimalist setup based around wireless peripherals. Space gray all day!
