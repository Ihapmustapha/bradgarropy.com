Lately I've been watching more developers on [Twitch][twitch]. Guys like [Jason Lengstorf][jason], [Chris on Code][chris], and [James Quick][james] all have some great content! I've [streamed][streams] quite a bit in the past on [YouTube][youtube], but I wasn't totally satisifed with the platform.

But now that I've decided to devote more time to streaming, it's time to revisit which streaming service is king. I broke this comparison down into two main parts, one for the [viewers][viewers] and another for the [creators][creators].

## ðŸ‘€ viewers

## ðŸ’» creators
