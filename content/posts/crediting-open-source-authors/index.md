You just found an awesome repository, and it works _almost_ exactly how you want.

## 🚥 create a pull request

todo

## 🍴 fork the repository

It shows where the work originated from, and you also get the benefit of being able to pull in any updates the developer may make in the future.

## 🎉 acknowledge the original author

Typically found in the README, an acknowledgements section can properly give credit to the original author. Best practice is to call out the developer by name and include a link to their Twitter, GitHub, or website.

## 💰 sponsor the developer

GitHub now offers sponsorship, where you can donate money to a developer who produces valuable code that you use.

## 💗 show some love

_Follow_ the developer on GitHub, or _Star_ the repository you find interesting. This helps the developer's work to be found more easily by others.
