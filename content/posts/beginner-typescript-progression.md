When I learned [TypeScript][typescript], I turned it on in a project and was confronted with tons of errors. It was a frustrating experience with a new technology. To alleviate the same frustration for you, this post will walk you through the first steps with TypeScript.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ basic types

There are a few foundational types that everything else is built on. The are `string`, `number`, and `boolean`. Below is an example of how to type variables using these [basic types][basic-types].

```typescript
const make: string = "Chevrolet"
const model: string = "Corvette"
const year: number = 2022
const new: boolean = true
```

When it comes to these primitive types, you do not have to explicitly declare them. The TypeScript compiler can _infer_ them

```typescript
const make = "Chevrolet"
const model = "Corvette"
const year = 2022
const new = true
```

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ array types

Types can also be used as [arrays][array-type] by placing a set of brackets `[]` after the base type. The examples below show all of the primitive types being used as arrays, but custom types can also be declared as arrays.

```typescript
const models: string[] = ["Tahoe", "Corvette", "Malibu"]
const prices: number[] = [70000, 80000, 40000]
const inStock: boolean[] = [true, false, true]
```

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ declaring types

Beyond primitive types, you can [declare your own types][type-alias] using the `type` keyword. This works just like assigning variables in JavaScript, but the right hand side of the expression must be a TypeScript type.

In this simple case, we are giving the name `Text` to a type, then using it to define the type of the `message` variable. Declaring types can help us think about complex values in simpler terms.

```typescript
type Text = string
const message: Text = "A secret message."
```

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ union types

Sometimes it can be handy to limit the type to a few specific options, that's where [union types][union-type] come in. In this example, we've declared a `Transmission` union type that can be only one of two `string` values. We can then use the custom `Transmission` type to describe the type of the `transmission` variable.

```typescript
type Transmission = "automatic" | "manual"
const transmission: Transmission = "manual"
```

Here is another example using a `number` union type. Union types can also be applied to more complex TypeScript objects, but we'll cover that in another post.

```typescript
type Doors = 2 | 4
const doors: Doors = 2
```

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ object types

TypeScript becomes super valuable with [object types][object-type]. Typically in JavaScript applications you are passing around complex objects from your API through your application. These objects can be typed as shown in the example below. Once an object has a type declaration, your editor will begin autocompleting the properies on the object.

```typescript
type Vehicle = {
    make: string
    model: string
    year: number
    new: boolean
    doors: Doors
    transmission: Transmission
}

const vehicle: Vehicle = {
    make: "Chevrolet",
    model: "Corvette",
    year: 2022,
    new: true,
    doors: 4,
    transmission: "manual",
}
```

As mentioned in the previous section, custom types can also be used as arrays. Here is the `Vehicle` type as an array.

```typescript
const vehicles: Vehicle[] = [
    {
        make: "Chevrolet",
        model: "Corvette",
        year: 2022,
        new: true,
        doors: 4,
        transmission: "manual",
    },
]
```

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ intersection types

Sometimes you might want to add additional properties to an existing object type, or combine two object types. You can use an [intersection types][intersection-type] to handle this. Here we are adding the `towingCapacity` property to the existing `Vehicle` type, and defining it as the `Truck` type.

```typescript
type Truck = Vehicle & {
    towingCapacity: number
}

const truck: Truck = {
    make: "Chevrolet",
    model: "Silverado",
    year: 2022,
    new: true,
    doors: 4,
    transmission: "automatic",
    towingCapacity: 7000,
}
```

## 7Ô∏è‚É£ typing functions

[Function types][function-type] are perfect defining boundaries, both the inputs and outputs can be typed. In the example below, you see the `name` input has a type of `string` and the function returns a type `string`.

```typescript
const greet = (name: string): string => {
    const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`
    return greeting
}
```

Just like in other cases, it's possible to extract a function type and give it a name. Here we defined the `Greet` type, which is then delcared on the `greet` function.

```typescript
const Greet = (name: string): string

const greet: Greet = name => {
    const greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`
    return greeting
}
```
